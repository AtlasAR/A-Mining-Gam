# A Mining Game

Initial Setup:

1: Edit the following files to allow connection to your database/server
                                          -\A-Mining-Game\includes\config.php
                                          -\A-Mining-Game\game\client.js
                                          -\A-Mining-Game\game\server.js
                                          
                                          
2: Create a config.js in \A-Mining-Game\game\node_modules

exports.dBHost = 'localhost';
exports.dbUser = 'root';
exports.dbPassword = '';
exports.dbDatabase = 'amg';               

3: Install required Node_Modules, best way to do this is to run the server.js and see what dependencies is missing

*MAKE SURE THE SERVER FILES ARE NOT IN YOUR ROOT DIRECTORY*
